# <Marketing Website Refactoring>

## Description

This project was created to refactor pre-existing code for a marketing website's homepage. The initial code had broken navigation links, incorrect code semantics, and poor accessibility features.
"Marketing Website Refactoring" as plainly put, sought to improve the code framework without disturbing functionality.

## Installation

Installation is not applicable. Feel free to view the improved website on GitHub pages.

## Usage

I've commented the changes I've made in both the HTML and CSS files for review. Feel free to peruse.

## Credits

I've used code initially created by GitHub user Xandromus (Xander Rapstine) to complete this project. His code could be found at https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram.
